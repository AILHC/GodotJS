## REPL

A simple `REPL`(read-eval-print loop) implementation is provided in the editor which can be open from the bottom panel `GodotJS`.  

A dropdown list will be shown if `auto-complete` is available for the input partial expression. Press `Up/Down` to select one, and `Tab` to confirm the selection.

> [!NOTE] 
> So far, `REPL` runs on the javascript runtime the `ScriptLanguage` using.
